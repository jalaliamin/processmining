# processmining

processmining is a small python helper library that adds functionality on top of other libraries to support process mining in action. 
It has dependencies to other libraries like [PM4Py](https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de/), so it is important that PM4Py is installed and configured correctly. Please follow the installation guide for PM4Py through [PM4Py installation guide](https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de/install).
You can find the source code for processmining library in [src](./src) folder.
